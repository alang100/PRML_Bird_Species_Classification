# PRML_Bird_Species_Classification
This was my major Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Project.

This was an evaluation of various machine learning classification models and data preparation steps to evaluate how they performed and compared to each other. It was a fantastic learning experience. 

### Project Abstract

The accurate identification of species is
important for all forms of biological, ecological and
evolutionary research. Many research projects
require accurate identification of species including:
population monitoring, studying biodiversity of
environmental habitats and the impact of climate
change on species distribution. There is an
abundance of images online today of birds that can
be used in datasets to train machine learning
algorithms to classify the species. This project
developed various models utilising three machine
learning algorithms, Random Forest, SVM and
CNN to classify the images of 10 species of birds.
Various methods were applied to the models and the
dataset including standardization, cross-validation
with hyperparameter tuning in a grid search and
feature reduction using PCA. Overfitting was
present in the training of all models. The best results
achieved were with a CNN model with an accuracy
of 83% on the test set. The CNN model proved to be
more accurate than the best random forest (64%)
and the SVM (69%). The dataset will be increased in
future work and the models will be developed
further.
